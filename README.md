# Java FX Kiosk Project

## Objective

This project aims to apply practical knowledge of Java FX by creating a dynamic and configurable kiosk that can be used by any company to display its advertising content. The implementation will involve concepts such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, CSS, and more.

## Project Description

The kiosk program developed in Java FX will meet the following specifications:

- The kiosk should be dynamic and configurable for displaying four types of content: local photos and videos, YouTube videos, and informational texts.
- Informational texts should allow specifying the text, scrolling speed, and display order.
- Ad images should allow selecting images, defining display time, and indicating the order of display.
- Local or YouTube videos can be managed together. Users can select local videos or provide YouTube links, and the playback order can be specified.
- To define the playback order for each content type, screens should be created for each type where the content is displayed as components, and the order can be adjusted by dragging them up or down.
- Users should be able to add, modify, and delete content at any time.
- The display screen of the kiosk should be fully configurable, allowing dynamic addition or removal of components (image, text, and video) through drag and drop. Text components should always take the full width of the screen, and their height can be dynamic. The position of each component should be customizable.
- Once the display screen is configured, there should be an option to start the kiosk in fullscreen mode and begin playing the content. All content in this view should adapt to the size of the monitor.
